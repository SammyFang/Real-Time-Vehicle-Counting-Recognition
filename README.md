# Real-Time Vehicle Counting Recognition

A real-time vehicle detection and counting system using OpenCV and Python to monitor motorcycle congestion at campus parking lot entrances. This project simulates real-world traffic scenarios and lays the groundwork for future deployment with live cameras, databases, and a web-based monitoring system.

## Features
- **Automated Vehicle Detection**: Uses computer vision to count motorcycles entering and exiting a parking area.
- **Real-time Processing**: Processes video feeds to analyze parking availability.
- **Scalability & Integration**: Designed for future integration with live surveillance and web dashboards.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Enables analysis of parking trends to assist infrastructure planning.

## Installation

### **Prerequisites**
- **Python 3.9+**

## Expected Output
The system processes the video feed, detecting and counting vehicles in real time.
